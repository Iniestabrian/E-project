                     Day is the national day of Canada which is celebrated on 1 July every year. It is a federal statutory holiday that celebrates the anniversary of the Canadian Confederation. Popularly, Canada Day is known as ‘Canada’s birthday’ and thus people celebrate Canada day like a festival with great pomp and show and have lots of fun.

Interestingly, Canada Day was initially called Dominion Day as Canada became a ‘kingdom in its own right’ within the British Empire. But soon, with slow and steady steps, Canada gained political control and governance over its own affairs and gradually became independent.

Since then, Canada Day is observed every year on 1 July to pay tribute to the people involved in the independence struggle; to remember and celebrate Canada’s independence.

                     look back at the history of Canada Day, it all began with Canadian Confederation, which occurred on 1 July 1867. The Constitution Act, 1867 was passed in the country which united the three separate colonies, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single Dominion within the British Empire called Canada.

To simplify, the passing of this Act gave the people of the country power to control the Canadian Constitution and became a national milestone in the way of the country’s independence.

Later, with the constitutional changes, Canada gained more political control and governance over its own affairs, such as national defence, foreign affairs and more.

                    <h1>Thanksgiving  Day</h1>

                   <br> <p><span style="margin-left:5%;">Thanksgiving </span>
                    weekend. For many, this long weekend really kicks off the autumn season. People across the country will spend it raking leaves, harvesting, shutting down the family cabin, and hopefully eating a delicious meal surrounded by friends and family. But where did this tradition come from?

                    Traditions of giving thanks long predate the arrival of European settlers in North America. First Nations across Turtle Island have traditions of thanksgiving for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. These traditions may include feasting, prayer, dance, potlatch, and other ceremonies, depending on the peoples giving thanks.

                     Thanksgiving is held on the second Monday of October every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.
