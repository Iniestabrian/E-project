               <br><p>
  
                  <span style="margin-left:5%;">Advent</span>  Sunday is the start of the Christian year and, in the Western churches, is four Sundays before Christmas. The Advent season continues until Christmas.
  
                  The word advent means coming and during the Advent season the main theme 
                  is preparing for the coming of Jesus the Christ: preparing to celebrate the birth of Jesus and preparing for the coming of Christ in our lives. Advent Sunday is marked in some churches by the lighting of the first of five candles
                  the final one being lit on Christmas Day representing Christ as the light of the world.

                <h1>All Saints' Day â€“ 1 November</h1>
               <br><p><span style="margin-left:5%;">The</span>
                  early followers of Jesus were called saints or 'holy ones'. Later in the first century, a Saint (with a capital S) was a great man or woman of the past who was formally recognised by the church as having lived a virtuous life of faith and who can be an inspiration to people today.

                  All Saints' Day is a festival on 1st November when many western Christian Churches honour and give thanks for both known and unknown Saints/saints. It used to be known as All Hallows Day (Hallows meaning a saint) and the feast day started the previous evening, the
                  of All Hallows or Hallowe'en. Many churches now move the festival to the nearest Sunday.

                <h1>Ascension Day</h1>
               <br><p><span style="margin-left:5%;">Ascension</span> 
                  Ascension Day mark the belief that Christ ascended to heaven after he was resurrected on Easter Day. It is normally celebrated 40 days after Easter following the Biblical accounts in the Gospel of Luke and in his Acts of the Apostles. Roman Catholics in England now celebrate it on the following Sunday.

                  The significance of the Ascension of Christ is twofold:
                  
                  It is seen to mark the end of the earthly appearances of the risen Christ before the disciples received Christ's Spirit at Pentecost.
                  It is regarded as a spiritual 'ascending' and return of the 'cosmic' Christ to God, with whom, it is believed, he was 'before' time.
                  Ascension Day belongs to the Easter celebrations and may be losing popularity among faithful Christians because it is not seen to have a direct consequence in their lives in comparison to the Easter resurrection theme of new life and the Pentecost theme of God's Presence / Spirit.
                  
                  Some Christians regard the Ascension of Christ as a theological statement rather than a simple 'event' (hence the single quotation marks in the second statement above).

                <h1>Christmas Day - 25 December </h1>
                <br><p><span style="margin-left:5%;">The</span>
                  25th of December is the time when Western Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus who Christians believe to be both the Messiah (or in Greek: the Christ) and son of God (that is, divine). Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate the birth on the 7th January.

                  Jesus' birth or 'nativity' is described in the Bible, in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and Luke. There is disagreement among Christians about the status of the accounts, some regarding them as describing theological truths but not historical ones. The Gospels do not mention the date of Jesus' birth which was set by Pope Julius in the 4th century CE in order to Christianise the Pagan celebrations that took place at that time of year.
                  
                  The story of the nativity was taught through traditions of plays and also models of the manger, or crib, that Luke's Gospel states that the Jesus was born in. Today the Christmas festival has elements of Christian, Pagan and folk traditions and many Christians and non-Christians have concerns about its over-commercialisation.

                <h1>Easter Sunday</h1>
               <br><p><span style="margin-left:5%;">Easter</span>
                 Day or Easter Sunday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus as the Christ (God's Anointed) after his death the Friday before . His disciples began to experience Christ to be with them in a new way. Easter eggs are given which symbolise the new life which Christians experience and see at the heart of God's world.

                <br><p><span style="margin-left:5%;">The</span>
                  most important events in Christianity are the death and 
                  resurrection of Jesus  whose life and teachings are the foundation of 
                  Christianity. Good Friday commemorates the death of Jesus by crucifixion and
                   is called
                   'Good' because of Jesus' example of sacrificial love by giving his life for the healing of the world. Christians meditate on Jesus' suffering and death and sometimes hold processions and / or re-enactments of the crucifixion.
