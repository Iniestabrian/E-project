                  Valley Festival, in full Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, annual rock festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif., U.S., featuring music on multiple stages.

                  The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival began in October 1999 as a two-day festival. Beck and Rage Against the Machine headlined, and more than 25,000 people attended, but the festival failed to make money. It was held just months after the disastrous Woodstock ’99, and it was unclear if promoters could turn a profit on a weekend-long multistage event. Coachella’s organizers took a year off and then brought the festival back as a one-day event in April 2001. (The change in month was also an effort to avoid high temperatures in the desert heat.) Coachella returned to a two-day format the following April and expanded to a third day in 2010.

                   electronic music tends to be better represented at Coachella than at other festivals, lineups have included the top names in rock, pop, and hip-hop, with a blend of emerging artists and established performers. Organizers remained committed to keeping the festival fresh, and very few acts have made repeat appearances. Headlining artists have included Madonna, Jay-Z, Portishead, and Paul McCartney. High-profile reunions were also a fixture of the festival, with groups such as Pavement, Faith No More, the Specials, and Iggy and the Stooges taking to the stage for the first time in years.

                    Aside from experiencing music performances, attendees can view art (especially sculpture) and enjoy food and drink. In 2010 organizers angered some attendees by eliminating single-day tickets in favour of full three-day festival passes. Attendance was not hurt, however, and Coachella set a record by attracting about 75,000 people each day.

                     in 1968, Summerfest is a multi-day event held in June and July featuring music, food, shopping, and family activities that bring more than 800,000 people to the Henry W. Maier Festival Park on the Milwaukee lakefront. Billed as “The World’s Largest Music Festival” by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1999, fans of all ages enjoy more 800 musical acts on multiple stages (as claimed by Summerfest) throughout the festival’s 75 acre grounds.

                     history includes a few precedents to the current lakefront festival as city planners have combined music and merriment by taking advantage of the prime Lake Michigan location. In 1898, Milwaukee celebrated the 50th anniversary of Wisconsin statehood by hosting a weeklong summer carnival with sailboat races, parades, band concerts, historical events, and an illuminated bicycle pageant. From 1933 through 1941, the lakefront was site of the Midsummer Festival, which featured parades, carnival rides, contests, and regattas.

                     current Summerfest is the culmination of the late Mayor Henry Maier’s vision in the early 1960s. After visiting Munich, Germany’s Oktoberfest, a mayoral panel proposed a 10-day event aimed at the city’s German heritage—even suggesting it be called Juli Spass, meaning “July fun,” but the festival board eventually voted for the Summerfest name.

                    Summerfest 1968 included events in 35 locations around the city and featured a car race, polka music, youth performances, air show, and comedian George Jessel. Although the next year’s event featured performances by the popular Bob Hope, it was less successful because of persistent cold and wet weather. Nevertheless, a committee of local business leaders raised funds to continue the event.
                    
                    Success over the years has depended on the careful guidance of the independent, private 501(c)(3) organization, Milwaukee World Festival, Inc., which maintains and develops the Henry Maier Festival Park. Executive directors have included former Green Bay Packer Henry Jordan, as well as James Butler and Bo Black; Don Smiley was hired as Chief Executive Officer in 2004.
