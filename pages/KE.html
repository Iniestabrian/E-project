                 colonial history of Kenya can be traced back to the year 1885 when the Germans invaded the coast of Kenya that had previously occupied by the Sultan of Zanzibar. Five years later, in 1890, Great Britain took over the German Territory and set up the East African Protectorate in the year 1895. The British settlers began arriving in the country in huge numbers and occupied the best and fertile agricultural districts that belonged to the natives. Only a few of the settlers moved to the northern parts of Kenya because it was very dry. Read more: https://www.tuko.co.ke/306935-madaraka-day-celebrations-history-tradition-do.html
                The year 1920 would see Kenya become an official colony of Britain. Land disputes were prevalent, and this resulted in the Mau Mau rebellion that put the country in a state of emergency in the period 1952-1959. The end of the apartheid policy in the year 1944 paved the way for a few of the local African officials to be appointed into the government. However, it was not until the year 1957 that the first elections were held in the country.               
                Jomo Kenyatta was elected on a Kenya National African Union ticket to form the first government. On 1st June 1963, the country attained self-governance following the election of Kenyatta as a prime minister. The country only managed to attain full independence from the British colonists on 12th December 1963.

               celebrated the first Madaraka Day on 1st June in 1963. Uhuru Gardens was selected as the venue for this event. Kenyans had gone through so much to achieve internal self-governance, and there was so much joy in the air during the celebration.

              <p><span style="margin-left:5%;">Mashujaa</span>
                 is celebrated on October 20th. If October 20th falls on a Sunday, the following Monday will be a holiday.

Mashujaa is Swahili for 'Heroes' and as such Mashujaa Day is also known as Heroes' Day.

It is a public holiday to honour all Kenyans who have contributed towards the struggle for Kenya's independence.

                 holiday used to be known as Kenyatta Day, named after Jomo Kenyatta, who was first Prime Minister and then President of Kenya.

Kenyatta was a prominent campaigner for the independence of Kenya from British rule. He was arrested in October 1952 along with five others (Achieng' Oneko, Bildad Kaggia, Fred Kubai, Kung'u Karumba and Paul Ngei) on charges of being members of the Mau Mau Society, a movement engaged in rebellion against Kenya's British rulers. The accused were known as the 'Kapenguria Six'.

The detainment of the six is seen as prominent event in the struggle for independence and was therefore commemorated with a public holiday on 20th October.

The holiday was first observed in 1958 mainly by activists, but quickly grew and was seen as a success by 1959.

After Kenya gained independence in 1963, the date was embedded in the law as Kenyatta Day.

When Kenya adopted a new constitution in August 2010, several changes were made to the public holidays observed in Kenya and Kenyatta Day was renamed to Mashujaa Day and the focus of the day was widened to include all those who contributed to the independence of Kenya.
