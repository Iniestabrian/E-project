                    <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Eid</span>   
                    al-Adha, or the “Feast of Sacrifice,” signifies the willingness of the Prophet Ibrahim, known as Abraham in Christianity and Judaisim, to sacrifice his son, Ismail as ordered by Allah. It is one of Islam’s most important holidays.

Usually lasting three to four days, and celebrated by millions of Muslims worldwide, the holiday begins on the 10th day of the Muslim calendar lunar month of Dhul-Hijja, at the time of Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. In the United States, Eid al-Adha 2021 is predicted to begin around July 19 or 20 (depending on sightings of the moon), and will end with the culmination of Hajj a few days later.

Considered the holiest of the two Eids, the other being Eid al-Fitr, or “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” that commemorates the end of Ramadan, it is one of two major Muslim holidays celebrated across the globe each year.

  <br>  <p> <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Because</span>
     Ibrahim was allowed to sacrifice a ram instead of his son, Eid al-Adha is traditionally celebrated on its first day, by those with means to do so, with the symbolic sacrifice of a lamb, goat, cow, camel or other animal that is then divided into threes to be shared equally among family, friends and the needy.

Muslim worshippers typically perform a communal prayer, or ṣalāt, at dawn on the first day of the festival, attend Mosque, donate to charities and visit with family and friends, also exchanging gifts.

                    <h1>Mawlid Al-Nabi</h1>
                    <p>
                       <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Maulid</span>  Al-Nabi marks the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), although some Muslims do not approve of this celebration and regard marking it as a religious innovation. Those Muslims who celebrate it do so joyfully, Shia Muslims celebrating five days after Sunni Muslims. Many Muslims regard it as an important festival because Prophet Muhammad is seen as a great blessing for the whole of humanity and it was to him that the Holy Qur'an was revealed. 

The most important part of Eid Maulid Al-Nabi is a focus on the character of the Prophet: his teaching, leadership, wisdom, suffering and how he forgave even his most bitter enemies.

                    <p>
                       <span style="margin-left:5%;">Ramadan</span>  
                       is a holy month of fasting, introspection and prayer for Muslims, the followers of Islam. It is celebrated as the month during which Muhammad received the initial revelations of the Quran, the holy book for Muslims. Fasting is one of the five fundamental principles of Islam. Each day during Ramadan, Muslims do not eat or drink from dawn to sunset. They are also supposed to avoid impure thoughts and bad behavior.

                    <span style="margin-left:5%;">During</span> Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk each day. They are supposed to avoid eating, drinking, smoking and sexual activity, as well as unkind or impure thoughts and words and immoral behavior.

                        <span style="margin-left:5%;">Ramadan</span>
                        is a time to practice self-restraint and self-reflection. Fasting is seen as a way to cleanse the soul and have empathy for those in the world who are hungry and less fortunate. Muslims go to work and school and take care of their usual activities during Ramadan; however, some also read the entire Quran, say special prayers and attend mosques more frequently during this time.

                        Muslims who have reached puberty and are in good health are required to fast. The sick and elderly, along with travelers, pregnant women and those who are nursing are exempt, although they are supposed to make up for the missed fast days sometime in the future or help feed the poor.

                        The first pre-dawn meal of the day during Ramadan is called “suhoor.” Each day’s fast is broken with a meal known as “iftar.” Traditionally, a date is eaten to break the fast. Iftars are often elaborate feasts celebrated with family and friends. The types of foods served vary according to culture.

                         conclusion of Ramadan is marked with a major celebration known as Eid al-Fitr (or Eid ul-Fitr), the Feast of Fast-Breaking. It starts the day after Ramadan ends and lasts for three days.

Eid al-Fitr includes special prayers and meals with friends and relatives, and gifts are often exchanged.
